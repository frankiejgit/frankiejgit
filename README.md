## Hello 👋

I'm a conservationist, wildlife enthusiast and adventure seeker who also happens to work in tech!

🌴 I'm passionate about rewilding, community-driven restoration and blending traditional ecological knowledge with digital methods to improve human-wildlife coexistence.

This is a personal repository where I store code used for graduate school projects, demos I have built for my role at Google, and any other side projects I complete on my free time.

🐆 I'm currently learning more about apex predator ecology and how to digitally model complex adaptive systems such as tropical rainforests.
🛰️ I'm currently working on using deep learning methods to identify areas with high restoration potential.

I graduated with a M.S. in Agroecology from the University of Florida 🐊 and recently began a PhD in Ecology at Oregon State University 🦫 If you are interested in collaborating, please reach out!
