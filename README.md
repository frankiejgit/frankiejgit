## Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a conservationist, wildlife enthusiast and adventure seeker who also happens to work in tech!

This is a personal repository where I store code used for graduate school projects, demos I have built for my role at Google, and any other side projects I complete on my free time. 

I will post any exciting news here from time to time, but please reach out to me if there is a project you would like to collaborate on!

__Note:__ Nothing here is an official Google solution nor is anything guaranteed to be upkept, unless explicitly mentioned.
